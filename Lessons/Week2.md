### Cellranger Output

This week we start with the cellranger outputs that we created in the previous exercise. <br>
Conveniently, the output folders from cellranger are also available at the following path: `/path/to/cellranger-outs/`

It is important to note that **cellranger** creates a new directory for each sample and there are many files/subfolders that are created within that directory. <br>
The count matrices produced by cellranger can be found in the `/sampleName/outs/` directory. The final count matrix that we will use for a given sample has the name `filtered_feature_bc_matrix.h5`
